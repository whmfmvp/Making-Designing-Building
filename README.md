Incorporated into the design is a DHT22 sensor dedicated to monitoring temperature and air humidity. This real-time data allows you to make informed decisions about adjusting the environment for your plants.

3. Soil Humidity Indicator:
A prominent feature is the LED light strip that visually communicates the soil humidity status. The color changes based on the soil moisture level, serving as a quick and intuitive indicator of your plant's hydration needs.

4. Watering Button:
Strategically placed on the front panel is a user-friendly button. When pressed, it activates the water pump, allowing you to conveniently water your plants with precision. Customized care is just a button away!
